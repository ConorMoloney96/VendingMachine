This program allows the user to control a vending machine simulation. Running VendingMachineSimulation at the command line starts the program by
creating a vending machine object that provides a list of options to the user. The user can Add Products, Show Products, Insert Coin, Remove Coin or buy a 
product. Inserting a coin prompts the user to choose which coin (5 cent, 10 cent, 50 cent, Euro) they would like to enter. This can be 
repeated until as many coins as are needed for a purchase have been added. The user can also choose to remove coins which will take all of the added coins 
out of the machine and inform the user what the total value of the removed coins is. The user can use Add Product to add a product to the machine's 
inventory. The user will be asked to specify the name, price and quantity of the product in question. Show products outputs to the user a list of 
all the products currently in the machine. The buy option presents the user with a list of products from which they can choose 1 to purchase. The quit option allows the 
user to exit the main menu.
